# Clustering
This repository contains my assignment on clustering for the data science course.  The assignment explores various clustering algorithms and their application to real-world datasets. It includes code implementations, documentation, and a detailed analysis of the results obtained. By uploading this assignment to GitHub, I aim to share my work with the data science community and showcase my understanding of clustering techniques.
